(*- any sequence that does not match the syntax-definition is treated as ordinary text. 
- a syntactically correct detected sequence must also match the semantic rules, otherwise it is treated as ordinary text.
- semantically incorrect tags are treated as syntactically incorrect.*)

(*- comments start with "<-" and end with "->" and can be inserted everwhere.*)

(*- indent must be the same for all lines, otherwise it is ignored. *)

(*- automatic numbering by using the "$" character instead of manual numbers.*)

(*- usage of undefined tags is not allowed.
- gMD has predefined and reserved tags.
- other tag definitions can be written inside the document or included (tag definition and include syntax not yet specified)
- escaped characters (preceeded by '\') are treated as ordinary characters and will be excluded from syntax analysis *)

Modifier = ("**"|"~~"|"^^"|"__");

(*- the sequence "**" is for bold on/off, "\~\~" is for italic on/off, "^^" is for suberscript on/off, "__" is for subscript on/off.*)

HorRuler = ("-----"|"=====");

(*- thin line: using "-" 
- thick line: using "="
- the lenght must be exact 5 characters*)

(*- manual numbered item: starts with number followed by ".". 
- manual alphabetical item: starts with letter followed by ")". 
- automatic numbered item: starts with "$" followed by "."; increments the preceeding item, default is 1. 
- automatic alphabetical item: starts with "$" followed by ")"; increments the preceeding item, default is a. 
- bullet list: starts with "*"
- dashed list: starts with "-" *)

(*- a ruler with "=" characters defines the cell above as header cell.
- a ruler with "-" characters defines the cell above as normal cell.
- a ruler with ":" defines the alignment for all cells below (until the appearance of the next ruler with ":").
- left-align: ruler starts with ":", right-align: ruler ends with ":", center-align: ruler starts and ends with ":".
- mixed usage of "=" and "-" is not allowed.*)

(*- colspan: starts with ">" followed by the number of columns to span; no number means 1.
- rowspan: starts with "/" followed by the number of rows to span; no number means 1.*)
