## Todo

- Change "Alias" to "Name/Identifier"
- Semantics: nearly all unicode characters and symbols are allowed. it is the resonsibility of the authors to not create messy documents
- Syntax and semantics: a tab is interpreted as the equivalent of 4 spaces
- Semantics explanation: Html-elements cannot be used in a gMD document
