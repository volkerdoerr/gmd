## Todo

- Change "Alias" to "Name/Identifier"

- Unicode  
  - Semantics: nearly all unicode characters and symbols are allowed. it is the resonsibility of the authors to not create messy documents  
  - Syntax and semantics: a tab is interpreted as the equivalent of 4 spaces

- Semantics explanation: Html-elements cannot be used in a gMD document
